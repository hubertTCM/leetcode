[Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/539/week-1-june-1st-june-7th/3351/)  

Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:

1 <= w.length <= 10000
1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]
Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.


```javascript

// This JavaScript function always returns a random number between min and max (both included):
function getRndInteger(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) ) + min;
}


/**
 * @param {number[]} w
 */
var Solution = function(w) {
    var total = [];
    
    var sum = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < w.length; i++){
        sum += w[i];
        total[i] = sum;
    }
    this.total = total;
    
    this.max = sum;
};

/**
 * @return {number}
 */
Solution.prototype.pickIndex = function() {
    var value = getRndInteger(1, this.max);
    for(let i = 0; i < this.total.length; i++){
        if (this.total[i] >= value){
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
};

/** 
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new Solution(w)
 * var param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
 */
```
