[Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/540/week-2-june-8th-june-14th/3355/)  

Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 10^4
Both strings consists only of lowercase characters.


```C#
using System;

namespace IsSubsequence

    public class Solution

        public bool IsSubsequence(string s, string t)
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(s))
            {
                return true;
            }
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(t))
            {
                return false;
            }
            if (t.Length < s.Length)
            {
                return false;
            }

            var c = new int[s.Length + 1, t.Length + 1];
            for (int i = 1; i < s.Length + 1; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 1; j < t.Length + 1; j++)
                {
                    if (s[i - 1] == t[j - 1])
                    {
                        c[i, j] = c[i - 1, j - 1] + 1;
                    }

                    }
                }
            }


            return c[s.Length, t.Length] == s.Length;
        }
