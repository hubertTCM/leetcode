[Queue Reconstruction by Height](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/539/week-1-june-1st-june-7th/3352/)  

Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

 
Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]

better solution from discussion:

```
First, create the result matrix and fill the k values with -1. Since there can't be -1 people in front of an element, this means this position is empty.
Sort the given input by their height in ascending order. (I used built-in Timsort and it's space complexity is O(n) but we can use an in-place sorting algorithm)
Then, iterate over the elements in the input.
For each element in the input, we will iterate over our result from beginning to the end.
While iterating, count the number of elements that are empty, or have bigger height than our current input.
If our count is equal to our current element's k value, we will stop the iteration and insert our element to the index we are at.
Complexity Analysis:

Time : O(n^2)
Space : O(n) with Timsort, can be O(1) with Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort.
PS: Since our algorithm operates in O(n^2) Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort won't change the Big-O Complexity.
